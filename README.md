# Hello! 😄

## Who am I?

I am a software engineering student graduating from Concordia University in 2022!

I am:

- Resourceful
- Curious
- A learner
- A self-starter
- A team player

## What do I like?

I am very passionate about the full-stack of an application, especially the back-end and "DevOps"-like things such as CI/CD pipelines, deployment, containers and orchestration, tooling, etc.

On the front-end, I am very fond of React.js, especially the Next.js framework!

I really enjoy building apps from ground, all the way up to deployment on my [self-managed servers](https://github.com/gordonpn/server-services-configs).
