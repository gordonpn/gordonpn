# Hello! üëã

## Who am I?

I am a software engineering student set to graduate from Concordia University in 2022!

I am:

* Resourceful
* Detail-oriented
* Self-starter
* Team player with positive attitude
* Curious

## What do I like?

I am very passionate about the full-stack of an application, especially the backend and "DevOps"-like things such as pipelines, deployment, containers and orchestration, tooling, etc.

That doesn't mean that I am not interested by frontend web development, right now React.js has all my attention, but I am open to explore more when the time comes.

I really enjoy building apps from ground up, all the way to deployment on my [home servers](https://github.com/gordonpn/server-services-configs).

Lately, I have been really into writing code in Go!

## What have I made?

* [Hot Flag Deals](http://deals.gordon-pn.com), a web app that aggregates the latest good deals from Red Flag Deals Hot Deals forum with an option to sign up for the newsletter. Written in Go and React.js.
* [Internet Speedtests Visualized](http://speed.gordon-pn.com), a web app collecting information about my home internet speeds and displays them. Written in Python and React.js.
* [GitHub Stats](https://stats.gordon-pn.com), collect my commits habits and programming language stats and displays them using Chart.js. Written in Python and React.js.

Check out my other projects on my [personal website!](https://gordon-pn.com/)

## What are my hobbies?

* Cycling, especially sprints and climbing hills üö¥
* Reading, non-fiction, a bit of philosophy, a bit of physiotherapy, basically anything that piques my interest! üìö
* Amateur calisthenics üòÖ
* Rock climbing, more specifically bouldering (but currently taking a hiatus) üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
