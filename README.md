# Hello! 😄

## Who am I?

I am a software engineering student graduating from Concordia University in 2022!

I am:

- Resourceful
- Detail-oriented
- Self-starter
- Team player with positive attitude
- Curious

**I am open for new grad opportunities, available as of May 2022.**

## What do I like?

I am very passionate about the full-stack of an application, especially the backend and "DevOps"-like things such as CI/CD pipelines, deployment, containers and orchestration, tooling, etc.

That doesn't mean that I am not interested by frontend web development, right now React.js has all my attention, but I am open to explore and learn.

I really enjoy building apps from ground, all the way up to deployment on my [home servers](https://github.com/gordonpn/server-services-configs).
